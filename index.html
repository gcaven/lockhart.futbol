      I know if I were you right now, I'd be crazy nervous about uprooting my life. But you’re like the smartest person I know and if anybody could go the UK and rock it, you can. We’re for sure gonna miss you back here, but I hope you have a great time in London. I want to come visit at some point (next summer??), so prep me an air mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as always, thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight, if you need me, I’m on my mobile.

      You are by far the most hard working and dedicated person I know. This is an opportunity all of us have been just waiting for you to get because if anyone deserves it, it's you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully you aren't gone for good but who knows. I'm sure you'll receive even more opportunities that are even sweeter than this one bc you ALWAYS out here kILLIN' IT. But regardless, if money permits you'll catch me coming out there to visit after I finish school in December.
    </p>
    <p>
      OK LOVE YOU BYE.
