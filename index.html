      I know if I were you right now, I'd be crazy nervous about uprooting my life. But you’re like the smartest person I know and if anybody could go the UK and rock it, you can. We’re for sure gonna miss you back here, but I hope you have a great time in London. I want to come visit at some point (next summer??), so prep me an air mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as always, thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight, if you need me, I’m on my mobile.

      You are by far the most hard working and dedicated person I know. This is an opportunity all of us have been just waiting for you to get because if anyone deserves it, it's you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully you aren't gone for good but who knows. I'm sure you'll receive even more opportunities that are even sweeter than this one bc you ALWAYS out here kILLIN' IT. But regardless, if money permits you'll catch me coming out there to visit after I finish school in December.
    </p>
    <p>
      OK LOVE YOU BYE.

    The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK)[10] or Britain,[note 10] is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, the UK includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland and many smaller islands.[11] Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another sovereign state‍—‌the Republic of Ireland.

  <p>Dearest Stanford,</p>

  <p>You a boss.  You a genius.  You loyal.  I appreciate you!</p>
  
  <p>
    I'm fairly certain I wouldn't have graduated if it wasn't for your ass.  You've come through for my butt so many times, and I hope I've been able to come through for your butt at least once along the way.  You a fun guy to be around, and you make me giggle sometimes.  You never shy away from a challenge it seems, which is a crazy good quality to have.  That's why even though it's sad you're leaving the boys, I know you still gonna flourish in your new place of living/twerking.
  </p>
  
  <p>XooxOOxOxO,</p>
